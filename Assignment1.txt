Assignment 1, from September 4:

1. Form a team of 2-5 people
2. Write code that crawls a website or pulls data from an API, and stores
that data as raw text files.
     - If crawling a website (e.g. Wikipedia), the application should
     follow links at least 2 deep.  That is, if you start the application
     at page A, and it links to page B, you should also collect all of the
     pages that B links to.
     - If pulling data with an API, draw from at least three resources
     (i.e. types of data) that can be connected in some way.  For instance,
     if you are pulling random tweets from Twitter, you might also collect
     (1) profile information and (2) friend/follower lists for the people
     that tweeted.
3. I recommend trying to get data you think would be interesting to work
with and/or visualize.  This would save you later work for the mid-term
project. 
4. Try to collect at least 10 megabytes worth of data (but no more than
100M; we'll get to the big data later).

By September 11, your team will hand in your code and some sample data (<1Mb).
